## University Programming Projects (Open Source Reference)

### Overview

As I approach graduation, I’ve decided to share several of my past programming assignments and course projects, all of which received H1 (First Class Honours) or above (about 95%).
 Every repository is released under the MIT License, allowing others to freely learn from, modify, or build upon these works.
 I hope these projects serve as a useful reference for future students and open-source enthusiasts.

> More repositories will be uploaded gradually as I continue organizing past work.
